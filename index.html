            <h1>NightZan999 - Developer and Student</h1>
            <br>
            <p>I am a student and a math fanatic. I absolutely love mathematics
                and have aced all exams taken on it! <br>
                These include Talent Olympiad, IMO and more!
                <br> <br>
                I like science as well, but just to a resonable 
                point. Out of the three sciences I like physics the most!
                <br>    
                Anyways, I know plenty of languages and I know coding!
                My uncle taught me coding since I was 6 years old and 
                I have been coding for a <b>really</b> long time now!
                <br> <br>
                I use git with github and upload plenty of languages!
                Below are the languages I use in the order I learned them!
            </p>
        </div>      
        <br> <br> <br>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row" id = "html">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2>HTML</h2>
                    <p>I learnt HTML as my first language. I learnt the basics in about 
                        3 months so yeah. Pretty basic language and I could create
                        okay webpages in like 3 months!
                        <br> <br>
                        I have coded a ton of HTML on github
                        so yeah. Be sure to check my github out 
                        for plenty of HTML code!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <i class="fas fa-code fa-10x"></i>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row" id = "css">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <br> <br> <br> <br>
                    <i class="fab fa-css3-alt fa-10x"></i>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2>CSS</h2>
                    <p>Yup, I needed to style my good webpages!
                        So I needed CSS <br> <br>
                        In about 6 months I had learnt a ton of CSS 
                        and become very advanced (not very but for 6 months). 
                        I learned hover elements and pseudoelements. 
                        <br> <br> And I learned CSS variables which is kinda cool. 
                        <br> <br> I kept learning this for one more year 
                        and then I had pretty much mastered it!
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row" id = "js">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                    <p>Its kinda surprising how I didn't go 
                        to something like python. <br> <br>
                        My uncle was not there to actually guide me before I picked my languages
                        He lived abroad and I had to write emails. 
                        <br> <br>
                        And I kinda wanted to experience
                        my coding journey myself. So I picked the choice to learn JavaScript 
                        alongside complex CSS and styling. 
                        <br> <br>
                        This was <b>probably the dumbest decision I ever made!</b>
                        I did learn about loops and more complex variables and after learning
                        let and const. I kinda gave up on JavaScript and in the end 
                        never became too good at it. <br> <br> Just okay, but this 
                        much learning was somehow enough for the future (I didn't know it yet :D)
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <br> <br> <br> <br> 
                    <br> <br> <br> <br> 
                    <i class="fab fa-js fa-10x"></i>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row" id = "php">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <br> <br> <br> <br> 
                    <i class="fab fa-php fa-10x"></i>
                    <br> <br> <br> <br> 
                    <br> <br> <br> <br> 
                    <i class="fas fa-server fa-10x"></i>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2>PHP</h2>
                    <p>Okay now you'd get really mad at me!
                    I went to JavaScript and now had the guts to survive PHP. 
                    <br> <br>
                    I learned it with my friend Yash Bhatnagar (check him out <a href= "https://superzackx.github.io">here</a>). 
                    <br> He is awesome at JavaScript. He wasn't so keen to learn PHP 
                    in the beginning. But then when he realized it was cool. He became 
                    better than me. <br> <br>
                    Turns out that when I learned it in detail (months later)
                    I realized I loved writing authentic PHP which made me install PHPStorm!
                    <br> <br> 
                    Now I was an experienced programmer and knew quite some languages. (I did not have CSS to both me now!)
                    <br> So then I just continued my journey! 
                    I became an awesome PHP dev after figuring out authentication with MySQL
                    and writing SQL queries! <br> <br> 
                    Then I finally made an XAMP and WAMP server 
                    which used MySQL, Apache and PHP! 
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br> <br> 
            <div class="row" id = "py">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2>Python</h2>
                    <p>Finally I learned Python. I felt really 
                        comfortable writing python. And went 
                        ahead and started using django and flask. 
                        <br> <br>
                        I still need to explore python's machine 
                        learning and AI capabilities!
                        But now I made a discord bot! Check projects 
                        for more information  <br> <br>
                        So yeah, once I finished learning this
                        I clearly had to go further. I used SQLite3 
                        as a database and had some fun with it!
                        <br> <br>
                        I realized that python is a vast language
                        with beginner friendly syntax and thus overall 
                        comfortable to write and read code in!
                        <br> <br>
                        I started to use PyCharm for this now!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <br> <br> <br> <br> 
                    <br> <br> <br> <br> 
                    <i class="fab fa-python fa-10x"></i>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row" id = "node">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <br> <br> <br> <br> 
                    <br> <br> <br> <br>     
                    <i class="fab fa-node fa-10x"></i>
                </div>  
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2>NodeJS</h2>
                    <p>So I talked about my friend Yash Bhatnagar
                        he figured out backend gizmo
                        with NodeJS and ExpressJS. I soon realized 
                        rather than moving to game engines. <br> <br>
                        To get good at websites is the main aim at frontend.
                        I already new PHP so this wasn't a problem. 
                        But having a new perspective to web developement 
                        was all I needed!
                        <br> <br>
                        The LAMP stack consists of Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP!
                        But the MEAN stack consists of MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and NodeJS.
                        <br> <br>
                        I soon realized that NodeJS was also really powerful!
                        And I quickly realized that I had to adapt to this new technology!
                        I read up ExpressJS docs and figured it out. I also compared it to PHP and 
                        thus got a better understanding of which one I like more!
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row" id = "java">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2>Java</h2>
                    <p>So I learned Java in about 2 months. I know just the basics
                        and am still learning more. Because I want to make minecraft mods and 
                        write productive Java. <br> <br> I really like Java
                        because everything in it is very Object oriented. 
                        <br> <br> Soon I will do some Java Projects probably with some 
                        sort of game!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <br> <br>
                    <i class="fab fa-java fa-10x"></i>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row" id = "sass">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <i class="fab fa-sass fa-10x"></i>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2>SCSS</h2>
                    <p>Finally I needed to get more powerful 
                        with styling dynamic webpages. 
                        I am currently learning this and 
                        will apply this to my future projects 
                        in a good way! <br> <br>
                        When I do learn more languages I will
                        keep updating this page! I am 
                        also learning Ruby and C#. But 
                        I know barely nothing in both these 
                        so I can't say I know them!
